# GitHub workflow

Repo: `praetorianer777/vorsorgereminder` · default branch: `main`

## Rules

- Every change needs an issue and a branch named `<type>/<issue>-<slug>`.
  Types: `feat fix chore docs refactor test perf ci build revert`.
- Never push to `main`. Never merge yourself — that is the user's decision.
- Agree on issues and PRs with the user before creating them.
- Always call `gh` non-interactively: `--title` / `--body-file`, never open the editor.
- `.claude/hooks/branch-guard.sh` enforces this; a violation is blocked, not commented on.

## Language

Everything in the repository is written in English: issues, pull requests, commit messages, code,
comments and documentation. The only exception is user-facing app content, which is localised in
both German and English via ARB files in `lib/l10n/` and per-language strings in the catalog JSON.

## Recipe

```bash
gh auth status                       # preflight

gh issue list --limit 20             # does the issue already exist?
gh issue create --title "..." --body-file /tmp/body.md

gh issue develop 42 --name feat/42-ics-export --base main --checkout

# ... work ...

./run-tests.sh                       # the hook runs this before every push anyway
git push -u origin HEAD

gh pr create --title "..." --body-file /tmp/pr.md   # body contains "Closes #42"
gh pr checks --watch
gh run view --log-failed             # when CI is red
```

## Releases

`release.sh` is the user's job. From an agent session, read only:
`gh release list`, `gh release view v0.1.0`.

## Pitfalls

- `gh issue develop` creates the branch on the remote and checks it out — no manual
  `git switch -c` needed.
- Branch slugs are lowercase ASCII: `feat/42-ics-export`, not `feat/42-ICS-Export`.
- Commit messages are Conventional Commits, lowercase, imperative, subject ≤ 72 characters, and
  describe the **effect** rather than the files touched.
- The PR number goes at the end of the subject once it is known.
